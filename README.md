In this era of maximised green house effect which lead us towards the harsh reality of climate change, 'clean and fresh drinking water for all' became a challenging phenomena. Almost every state is impacted by the serious problem of water quality. Only three percent of the water on Earth is freshwater. The remaining portion is either frozen as ice caps, glaciers, and permafrost, or buried deep into the earth. Only 1.2% of it may be used as drinking water. By using a data-driven method to evaluate those features, we may be able to gain a better understanding of the factors that affect water quality. Water safety has a fundamental relation to the potability of the water. That feature can be analyzed using data techniques.
In this project we've dealt with a small dataset of water quality. To find hidden insights in the data, we've used data analysis techniques with pandas and numpy. The libraries seaborn and matplotlib have been used to visualize the data. A range of exploratory data analysis techniques have been applied in order to provide more clarification regarding the quality of the data.
